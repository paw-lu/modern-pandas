# Modern Pandas

A collection of best practices for using Pandas effectively. Each section includes a
Python and accompanying Markdown file that may be synced to a Jupyter Notebook via
[Jupytext](https://github.com/mwouts/jupytext)

## Sections

- [**Intro**](modern-pandas/intro.md) – Load the data, and introduce `.loc`, `.iloc`,
  `SettingWithCopy` warning, and Multidimensional indexes.

_A lot_ of examples and code were collected from the excellent
[**datas-frame**](https://tomaugspurger.github.io/archives.html) blog.

- [**Method chaining**](modern-pandas/method-chaining.md) – Chain methods together
